### Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
### Search/tuning hyperparameter, speed up learning algorithm, optimization
### Week 1: recurrent neural networks
  * speech recognition, music generation, sentiment classification, DNA sequence analysis, machine translation, video activity recognition, name entity recognition
  * supervised learning, mapping x and y
  * NLP: dictionary representing words: size 30k, or 1M
  * a standard network does not share features learned across different positions of text, RNN reduces the number of parameters
